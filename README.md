<h2 id="Goals">Goals</h2>
<p>The primary goal for this project was to create portfolio of work can showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. The secondary goal was in this Challenge to set yourself up for future success by applying the core skills we've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.</p>

<h2 id="Acceptance Criteria">Acceptance Criteria</h2>
<text>Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:</text>
<ul>
  <li>When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you</li>
  <li>When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications</li>
  <li>When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others</li>
  <li>When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application</li>
  <li>When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport</li>
</ul>
